# SampleWork01.2020
Sample Work as of January 2020

This repository contains a sample of my work as of January, 2020. It is divided into two folders - work that comes from my coursework, and work that comes outside of the classroom from my internship and fellowship experiences. This README file contains additional information to provide context for the work that is included in this repository. 

Please be aware that much of the R Code in this repository cannot be run without errors. This is because much of the R code was either created in a specific context of additional code or it imports files that I could not take home with me and/or no longer have access to.
