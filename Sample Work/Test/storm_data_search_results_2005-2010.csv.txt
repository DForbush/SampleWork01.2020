This storm produced several weak tornadoes, but will be know for the very large hail and damage it produced. Hail between baseball and softball size occurred during some of its life with golf ball size occurring throughout its life. Dozens of vehicles were damaged along the path from the very large hail.||The day was setup by near record high temperatures and a very moist and unstable atmosphere. A potent low pressure system and cold front developed over North Texas early Tuesday. As the area of low pressure deepened and tracked northeast across Central Oklahoma and Northwest Arkansas the combination of unstable air and strong wind shear lead to a tornado and severe weather outbreak across the Southeast US. This was just the first round of severe storms to impact the region. A line of storms developed along a pre-frontal trough early Tuesday evening and quickly moved east across the area through early Wednesday morning bringing with it damaging winds and hail.||This outbreak of severe storms produced a little over 80 tornadoes which were responsible for 56 fatalities and hundreds of injuries across about 9 states. Of those 80 plus tornadoes, 5 were rated EF3 and 5 more rated EF4. The longest tornado occurred in north-central Arkansas and was on the ground for 123 miles and was rated and EF4.

Additionally, a couple homes and outbuildings were damaged by limbs or trees falling on them. The tornado intensified again and narrowed as it approached Highway 49 and the south gate of Camp Shelby. A number of large trees were downed along the highway, and from there to the actual gate of Camp Shelby. One large tree fell on a mobile home on the east side of Highway 49, destroying it. Shingles were pulled off a couple commercial buildings along the highway as well and 2 power poles were snapped. This area was where the tornado reached its maximum intensity. As the tornado moved across Camp Shelby, it remained narrow, but not as intense, with winds likely in the 70 to 80 mph range. The tornado downed numerous large limbs and sporadic trees as it moved across the base. One large tree fell on base quarters home, causing serious damage to it, and another tree fell on a vehicle, destroying it. Some other minor roof damage was noted. The tornado continued causing sporadic tree damage as it crossed Highway 98 near the Perry County line where it dissipated. Maximum winds were around 105 mph. The total path length across Lamar and Forrest Counties was 15 miles.","Multiple rounds of storms evolved over the region starting late on the 14th and lasted through the 15th.

It took shape as a tropical depression on the morning of August 25th just southeast of Haiti, and rapidly strengthened to hurricane status by the morning of August 26th. After inflicting serious damage on portions of Haiti, Jamaica, and Cuba, Gustav entered into the southeastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico and took aim at the Gulf Coast of the United States. Although Gustav attained Category 4 status earlier in its life, Gustav eventually made landfall as a strong Category 2 system at Cocodrie, Louisiana, on September 1st, containing maximum sustained winds around 110 mph. Gustav slowed down and weakened as it continued on its northwest track across southern Louisiana where major damage was inflicted. The pace of the system continued to slow dramatically over the next few days as it turned gradually to the right around a large ridge of high pressure over the Southeast. The remnants of Gustav finally began moving rapidly away from the Lower Mississippi Valley on the 4th as an incoming disturbance deflected it to the northeast. Gustav was responsible for multiple hazardous weather elements across the service area such as tropical storm force winds, tornadoes, flash flooding, and areal flooding from extensive rains.||As the center of Gustav crossed much of southern Louisiana, tropical storm force winds extended into southern Mississippi and portions of east central Louisiana.
