The first event began on the afternoon of Monday, November 28th and ended around midnight on Tuesday, November 29th . A potent upper level low pressure system spinning over the Northern Plains caused a strong surface low pressure system to develop and rapidly race northeast from the Central Plains to the Great Lakes region. This resulted in a strong cold front racing east into and through the ArkLaMiss region. As it did so, it encountered a strongly wind-sheared and marginally unstable air mass over the area. This equated to a line of storms racing east across the ArkLaMiss, that downed numerous trees and powerlines across the area. Numerous trees were also reported down well ahead of the front due to widespread sustained gradient winds between 25-35 mph, gusting between 40-50 mph at times over the ArkLaMiss.

As warm moist unstable air overspread the region from the south, both wind shear and forcing over the region became adequate, such that supercell thunderstorms began developing and moving northeast through the area.
