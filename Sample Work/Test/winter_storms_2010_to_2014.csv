The heaviest was across the northern portions. Several accident were reported due to the slick roads.","Winter precipitation struck the ArkLaMiss again for the second time in about a week. A continued cold airmass remained in place over the region thanks to several rounds of cold air intrusions over the ArkLaMiss. Moisture increased over the area ahead of an upper level disturbance. Precipitation began moving in from the west during the morning hours of Feb 9th. The Mississippi Delta saw only snow and had a dusting of snow on the ground by the noon hour. The remainder of the ArkLaMiss began as rain and slowly transitioned to a rain/snow/sleet mix as the morning and afternoon progressed. Temperatures slowly began to fall over the region and the rain transitioned to snow across the I-20 corridor by mid afternoon. As the upper level disturbance tracked east across the area, precipitation continued across the region with the Mississippi Delta continuing to see all snow, and areas along the Highway 84 corridor seeing all rain. The section in the middle of the ArkLaMiss, generally along the I-20 corridor, ended up being in the mixed precipitation zone. Temperatures flirted with the freezing mark and rain transitioned to snow, but generally not long enough in the Jackson area to accumulate very much. Snow accumulation was greater in Vicksburg and then over to Meridian, but the Jackson metro area was just too warm just above the surface which enabled the snow to melt enough into a cold rain. Some locations in far northern Mississippi saw snow amounts of 7 to 8 inches. Overall, total snowfall amounts within in the Jackson service area were generally 4 to 6 inches. This was generally along the Highway 82 corridor, with the highest snowfall amount of 6 inches being reported near Winona and Starkville. Snowfall of 2 to 4 inches fell from Southeast Arkansas through northern Madison County to northern Lauderdale County. Further south, along the I-20 corridor, amounts were around one half of an inch in locations that saw more rain than snow.

Over two inches of snow covered most of the far southern portion of the county. Some areas in the far southeastern portion of the county had over three inches of snow.","Temperatures on January 27th were in the upper 40s in the northwest Delta to mid 50s to low 60s in southeastern Mississippi. However, a large upper trough was diving southeast, bringing an arctic front toward the ArkLaMiss. Temperatures dropped rapidly in the evening as very dry air filtered into the region, with dew points falling into the single digits. The large spread between the surface and dew point temperature would be an important player in the winter weather event on January 28th. As the upper trough deepened and strong upper level winds began to move over the region, an upper level low center over northern Mexico to the southwestern United States began to merge with the strong upper level system and moistened the mid-levels of the atmosphere across the region. Temperatures were only in the low to mid 20s throughout the ArkLaMiss as the precipitation began to fall. Areas along and north of a line from around Natchez to just south of Meridian began to observe precipitation that initially fell as sleet but gradually transitioned to snow in a few hours as temperatures cooled in the mid-level s of the atmosphere and the lower atmosphere saturated from falling precipitation and evaporative cooling. Due to a warm layer in the mid-levels of the atmosphere, mixed precipitation occurred from south of a line near Natchez to south of Meridian. The deep melting layer caused precipitation to remain as sleet throughout most of the afternoon south of that line. These areas had a prolonged period of sleet before finally transitioning over to snow in the mid to late afternoon hours. All precipitation moved out of the region by around 6-8pm on the evening of January 28th.||In total, areas north of the mixed precipitation line had more significant snowfall. This was a heavy confined band of precipitation that dropped off quickly closer to the Jackson metro with areas in southeastern Rankin County having the highest snowfall totals. This area had two to four inches of snowfall, with maximum of four inches in the Puckett area.
