This outbreak brought 13 tornadoes to the forecast area. This occurred as potent storm system moved out of the Rockies and developed a strong area of low pressure across the Central Plains. This surface low caused a warm front to take shape and quickly lift northward across the forecast during the afternoon of the 29th. Warm and humid conditions pushed north, which led to unstable conditions over the region just ahead of the advancing strong cold front. The wind energy through the atmosphere was strong. The resulting wind shear (change in wind speed or direction with height) was strong and very favorable for rotating storms and supporting tornadoes. As the clash of systems occurred, a mix of supercell thunderstorms developed, along with a broken line of thunderstorms. A handful of these storms utilized the strong wind shear present and produced tornadoes. Overall, 13 tornadoes occurred with 5 being of the strong variety (EF2-EF3). The strongest tornado occurred over northwest Leake and southern Attala Counties. Here, an EF3 moved along a 10 mile path and destroyed numerous mobile homes, 6 people were injured. Four other strong tornadoes occurred and were all rated EF2. Two of these occurred in Yazoo County, one just southwest of Yazoo City and the other in Downtown Yazoo City. Numerous buildings were damaged along with many trees and power lines down. Another EF2 occurred in Starkville where it destroyed multiple mobile homes in town. Fifteen injuries occurred in this area. The final EF2 occurred in Smith County. This tornado had an 11 mile path which started just SW of Raleigh to 6 miles NE of Raleigh.

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties.

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant.

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear.

Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant.

The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant. The other violent tornado to impact the Jackson, MS forecast area occurred across Smith, Jasper, and Clarke Counties. This tornado continued into Alabama and had a total path length of 124 miles across both states.||Loss of life during this historic event was staggering. Unfortunately, 321 people lost their lives making this the second deadliest tornado outbreak in U.S. history. The March 18, 1925 Tri-State tornado outbreak is first with 747 fatalities.

In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon.

As the tornado moved northeast along Bailey Road and crossed County Road 130, it intensified and produced high end EF-1 damage, snapping and uprooting trees, taking shingles off roofs, and blowing skirting out from mobile homes. The tornado continued to strengthen as it moved northeast, and along County Roads 136, 107, and 105, it produced damage indicative of high end EF-2. A few mobile homes were destroyed and several homes and buildings sustained significant roof damage, along with extensive tree damage. Along County Road 105, a mobile home was picked up by the tornado, bounced along the ground a couple of times, and was then thrown into woods across the road, with debris scattered for at least a mile downstream, including the frame of the mobile home. The occupant of the mobile home was the first fatality of this tornado. The tornado continued northeast, and reached its most intense and widest point in the Smith County portion of the tornado just before crossing the county line at County Road 103. Here, in the central core of the tornado there was an area of completely mowed down pine trees in which everyone was snapped and many were denuded, and two frame homes had the roofs and exterior walls completely destroyed with extensive damage to interior walls. In addition, many power poles were snapped, a mobile home was annihilated, and a large shop building was completely destroyed. The damage here was rated high end EF-3 with maximum estimated winds of 160 mph.||The tornado remained intense as it crossed into Jasper County and moved across County Road 13, causing very impressive tree damage with nearly every pine tree snapped and extensive evidence of denuding and debarking. Power poles were also snapped. The tornado produced similar type damage as it crossed County Road 16. The tornado then produced its first area of EF-4 damage just northwest of Louin along County Road 164. Here, the tornado struck an area with several mobile homes and one frame home. The frame home was completely destroyed, with most interior walls down and some of the foundation pushed clean. Several mobile homes in the area, including two double wides which the residents said were well strapped down, were completely destroyed with the debris and frames blown great distances. In fact, all of the debris was so dispersed and mixed that it was impossible for the surveyors to reconstruct the positions of the mobile homes and house without explanations from the residents. Two people were killed in a mobile home at this spot; however, several other people abandoned their mobile homes after hearing warnings to shelter in a nearby brick home, and were certainly saved from serious injury or death. ||After crossing Highway 15, the tornado weakened and narrowed somewhat. As it crossed County Road 23, it produced EF-2 damage, destroying two mobile homes and causing extensive tree and powerline damage. The tornado then produced a relatively narrow path of EF-1 tree and powerline damage for several miles, until reintensifying near Rose Hill. As the tornado crossed Highway 18 southeast of Rose Hill, it removed most of the roof of a frame home and caused heavy damage to the exterior walls, took a large section of roof off another frame home, completely destroyed a large tied down mobile home, and caused extensive tree damage. This damage was rated at the low end of EF-3. After causing this damage, the tornado weakened again, causing mainly EF-1 type tree damage until it reached the Clarke County line, with the last point inside the county line on County Road 22 rated as EF-0, with just a few trees and limbs down. ||The tornado then continued into Clarke County and reintensified somewhat, causing tree and powerline damage as it crossed Interstate 59 and US Highway 11. The tornado then became much more intense as it moved along the south side of the town of Enterprise. A number of homes and mobile homes were heavily damaged or destroyed along County Road 320 and State Highway 513. This damage was rated as high EF-2 to low end EF-3. As the tornado passed along a two mile stretch of State Highway 519 east of Enterprise, it heavily damaged several frame homes and caused extensive tree damage. One spot here was the other area of EF-4 damage produced by this tornado. A new construction frame home was completely leveled with the debris swept off the foundation. Residents in the area reported that the house was nearly completed. Based on these reports and the extent of other nearby, primarily tree, damage, this damage is being rated EF-4 with maximum winds of 175 mph. Other damage in this general area was rated as high end EF-2 or low end EF-3. ||The tornado weakened slightly again as it crossed US Highway 45 and State Highway 145, and then caused high end EF-2 and low end EF-3 damage at County Roads 456 and 457. Here, several strapped down double wide mobile homes were destroyed with debris strewn over long distances. Nearby residents reported that one of the mobile homes was occupied by 11 persons at the time of the tornado, and that this was the location where 4 people were killed. Another resident of a nearby mobile home was critically injured. From here, the tornado passed east northeast, just north of the Energy and Snell communities, causing EF-2 damage to a number of frame homes along with extensive tree and powerline damage. The tornado crossed Highway 514 northeast of Snell, still causing extensive tree damage and significant roof damage to several large frame homes, before moving across the state line into Choctaw County, Alabama. The tornado continued into Alabama for 59 miles, bringing the total path length to 124 miles.","A historic outbreak of tornadoes across the Ark-La-Miss began late on Tuesday, April 26th continuing into the early morning hours of Wednesday, April 27th. The event ramped up again during the early afternoon of April 27th continuing into the early evening.  The activity on April 26th began as supercell thunderstorms producing large hail and tornadoes across northeast Texas and portions of Arkansas before evolving into a squall line as it moved east. This line of storms had multiple stages of evolution and moved across several states before dissipating. This line was very efficient in producing wind damage as it pushed east. More impressively, this line was responsible for 23 of the 32 tornadoes that occurred across the Ark-La-Miss during this event. Of those 23, 12 were rated as strong (EF2, EF3) tornadoes and had fairly long path lengths.||The atmosphere reloaded quickly Wednesday morning and became increasingly favorable for more severe storms by early afternoon. The driving force for the activity Wednesday afternoon was a potent shortwave and deep surface low that intensified during the day. The winds in the mid levels of the atmosphere increased to 80-100 mph helping to deepen the surface low further, which in turn caused the low level winds to become stronger. The wind shear caused by the turning of the winds from south near the surface to westerly aloft was at rare levels for late April over the Deep South. In addition, an abundance of low level moisture returned to the area in wake of the morning complex. Sunny skies during the morning interacted with the high levels of low level moisture eventually leading to a very unstable air mass by early afternoon. The result was an extremely rare mix of instability and wind shear. These ingredients, along with lift from a potent upper disturbance, ultimately led to the historic tornado outbreak of April 27, 2011.||By early afternoon, several discrete supercell thunderstorms were developing across central and eastern Mississippi. It did not take long for these storms to take on ���classic��� supercell structures and begin producing tornadoes. The first tornado of the afternoon started in Neshoba County on the north side of Philadelphia. This tornado ended up producing EF-5 damage and tracked for 29 miles across Neshoba, Kemper, Winston and Noxubee Counties. Through the rest of the afteroon multiple tornadoes developed, stemming from multiple supercell storms. Nearly all of the storms produced tornadoes, with many of them long track and significant.

Most of the tin roof of a barn was removed at this location, and a large part of a large oak tree fell on a mobile home. As the tornado tracked northeast, it weakened only downing a few trees along the path.

However, Lee was still moving very slowly to the north northeast, dumping large quantities of rain and spawning tornadoes across portions of southern Louisiana, southeastern Mississippi and other portions of the Gulf Coast. ||As the center of Lee continued to trek northward, heavy rain bands spiraled across much of central Mississippi producing significant flooding issues. Rainfall amounts of 4 to 10 inches were common across the NWS Jackson County Warning Area, with a few locations reporting amounts of 10 to 13 inches. Significant flash flooding was reported in the Jackson metro area, along with a few locations in southern Mississippi. Reports from emergency manager officials indicated that at least 50 homes, 60 apartment units and several other buildings were flooded by Monday morning. Numerous vehicles in the Jackson area were flooded, primarily in low-lying parking spots. Dozens of roads and bridges were washed out in central Mississippi.

Other smaller creeks also came close to flood stage. ||In addition to the significant rainfall and flooding, tornadoes also occurred with Tropical Storm Lee. Four confirmed tornadoes occurred in the Jackson County Warning Area. As is the case with most tropical systems, these tornadoes were very brief and fairly weak.

By the evening of Thursday, 1 September 2011, the tropical wave further developed into Tropical Depression 13. By 1 PM the following Friday afternoon, Tropical Depression Lee had formed. Lee slowly moved northward towards the south central Louisiana coastline by Saturday afternoon 3 September, while continuing to produce extremely heavy rainfall over portions of southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi, southern Alabama and the northwest Florida Panhandle. ||The outer rain-bands of Lee produced near-continuous heavy rainfall over portions of southern Alabama, southeastern Mississippi and the northwestern Florida Panhandle by early Saturday morning and that endured through early Sunday before dry air aloft wrapped into Lee���s western side. The center of Lee moved over land around sunrise Sunday, 4 September. However, it would be a while before Lee would weaken to a depression because it remained nearly stationary while the southern half of the circulation was over water where it could continue to derive additional energy from the warm ocean. The next day, Lee was eventually picked up by an upper air trough, turned northeastward and resumed a faster forward speed late in the day on Sunday, 4 September as it began its welcome exit to the northeast late Sunday through late Monday.||Lee���s impacts were far reaching across our region. Although the continuous rains became somewhat intermittent as dry air wrapped into Lee from the west, this created a situation from Sunday afternoon through midday Monday whereby individual thunderstorms became more intense due to increasing levels of atmospheric instability. Stronger thunderstorms and isolated tornadoes affected the North Central Gulf Coast Region, as they formed within the detached outer spiral rain-bands well to the east of Lee���s center on Sunday and finally to the southeast on Monday. The highest total storm tide levels (astronomical plus surge effects) ranged from approximately 3.5 to just barely over 5 feet.||While Lee was in the process of being picked up by a fast moving upper air trough, a series of squall lines that produced moderately widespread thunderstorm wind damage along and ahead of the surface cold front, as well as more isolated tornadoes, affected the area through late Monday afternoon. In all, some 10 to 15 inches of rain fell along coastal sections of Alabama and northwest Florida. Additionally, several weak tornadoes occurred producing modest structural and tree damage. There was also moderate beach erosion and the rip currents endured over a multi-day period. Inland flooding was exacerbated along the immediate coastal zone by higher tide levels due to Lee���s surge effects which created poor to no drainage of area coastal rivers, bays and sounds on during astronomical high tide cycles from 3-5 September (late night hours each day).",180

Further to the north, flooding issues were not quite as bad with about 5 to 7 inches of rain falling from the I-20 corridor and north. Tropical storm force wind gusts were noted as far north as Bolivar County, with the Golden Triangle region not seeing winds reach more than tropical depression strength. The worst of the wind was felt generally along and south of an axis from Marion County to Adams County. Numerous trees were down in Adams County, leaving many without power for several days. Eighty percent of the roads were blocked in Franklin County due to downed trees. ||With all of the rain that fell, some of the area rivers filled quickly. Minor flooding was recorded on the lower Pearl River at Rockport and Monticello, as well as on Bouie Creek at Hattiesburg and Tallahala Creek at Laurel. The biggest river impact in the Jackson Hydrologic Service Area was on Black Creek at Brooklyn. Black Creek entered moderate flooding and finally crested at 26.71 feet on August 31st at 5pm. This will go down as the second highest crest in history for this particular river and forecast point. This river flooding caused damage to 15 homes both upstream and downstream of the river gage. ||The winds and flooding were not all Isaac brought as a couple of tornadoes touched down in eastern Mississippi. Two tornadoes, one in Clarke County and one in Lauderdale County, occurred during the morning of August 30th. Both were rated EF-1 with winds around 100 mph. The tornado in Clarke County, near Crandall, resulted in 3 injuries to residents of a mobile home. One death attributed to Isaac occurred in Holmes County when a 64 year old woman was killed by a tree falling on her car. Isaac finally moved out of the region by the afternoon of the 30th, and was downgraded to a tropical depression by late afternoon on the 30th as it continued to track to the northwest into Missouri and the Ohio Valley.",219

The warm front slowly moved north and by mid to late afternoon, dew points had finally increased to the mid and upper 50s across the I-20 corridor and were in the mid 60s further south. This helped to fuel additional showers and thunderstorms as the main upper level storm system tracked northeast. As the moisture increased across the region, the combination of strong wind shear and an unstable air mass south of the warm front became more conducive to supercell and tornado development. Strong storms were moving through the southwestern portions of the region later that afternoon. ||Around 5 pm storms began to exhibit rotation on radar and a tornado developed in Concordia Parish just south of Clayton.

Dew points were still in the upper 30s as of late morning across Central Mississippi. Some showers and isolated thunderstorms moved through the area producing small hail. The warm front slowly moved north and by mid to late afternoon, dew points had finally increased to the mid and upper 50s across the I-20 corridor and were in the mid 60s further south. This helped to fuel additional showers and thunderstorms as the main upper level storm system tracked northeast. As the moisture increased across the region, the combination of strong wind shear and an unstable air mass south of the warm front became more conducive to supercell and tornado development. Strong storms were moving through the southwestern portions of the region later that afternoon. ||Around 5 pm storms began to exhibit rotation on radar and a tornado developed in Concordia Parish just south of Clayton. This tornado produced some damage to some homes and trailers in the area. As the low pressure gradually tracked northeast and the warm front lifted further north, the environment became more favorable for tornadoes in southern Mississippi. One storm had continuous rotation as it moved from north-central Louisiana into south-central Mississippi. This storm crossed southeast Lawrence to northwest Marion counties around 10 pm and continued to track northeast. Rotation began to intensify and a strong tornado developed around 10:30 pm a few miles southwest of Bassfield. This tornado caused minor to moderate damage to some homes and buildings, snapped some power poles and caused extensive tree damage. Another weak tornado developed around 11 pm a few miles southwest of Collins snapping some trees and causing some damage to a mobile home and a chicken house. Scattered storms continued to affect the Pine Belt area into the early morning hours on the 22nd, before finally moving out of the area.||In addition to severe weather, flash flooding became an issue in central Mississippi. From the morning of the 21st through the early morning of the 22nd, the heaviest rainfall occurred over parts of central Mississippi, where 3 to 4 inches of rain fell and flash flooding was reported in the area.",264

The tornado began in Chicot County, southeast of Dermott, and tracked through Chicot and Desha counties in Arkansas, before dissipating in Bolivar County Mississippi northwest of Cleveland. As the squall line progressed east through the late afternoon and evening multiple trees and power lines were downed across Mississippi. A 64 mph wind gust was recorded at the Cleveland Municipal Airport. The line of storms weakened later in the evening and finally moved out of the region in the early morning hours of December 22nd.||In addition to the damage from the line of storms, strong gradient winds ahead of the storms caused trees and power lines to fall in Adams, Clarke and Jones counties.

This event was driven by a classic severe weather pattern with a strong fast moving jet stream and a deep surface cyclone over the central plains. These features helped to produce strong wind shear in the atmosphere which in turn combined with rich gulf moisture and setup a volatile atmospheric mix. Multiple supercell thunderstorms developed during the afternoon/evening and produced many instances of damaging wind and large hail along with multiple tornadoes. The most devastating tornado was the EF-4 which tore a path across NE Leake, the corners of Attala/Neshoba counties, and through the heart of Winston County where the city of Louisville was especially hard hit. This tornado was on ground for 34.3 miles and resulted in 10 fatalities and many injuries. Other hard hit counties were Lowndes, Rankin, Hinds, Scott, Newton, Montgomery, Warren and Jones.
