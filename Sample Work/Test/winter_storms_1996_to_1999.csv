Much of the fall and early winter season of late 1998 had been very mild for southerners. But on Tuesday December 22nd,  a strong surge of shallow Arctic air drove southward and spelled a quick end to the unseasonable warmth and helped set the stage for one of winter's nasty tricks. A moist southwest flow above the cold air brought several upper level disturbances. This combination of  cold air and moisture held together for several days and brought periods of freezing rain and sleet to the three state region, beginning tuesday night and not ending until Christmas morning.
