The first, on the night of the 22nd, brought mostly rain to the region but some light icing occurred in the far northern Delta early on the 23rd. A second, more potent disturbance, moved through Central Mississippi during the afternoon and evening hours on the 23rd. This brought a more significant icing event to locations generally along and north of I-20, causing some power outages and accidents.||With the cold remaining in place, the final round of wintry weather moved in on the morning of the 25th. A strong upper level disturbance moved across the region, which induced a low pressure system to move east across the northern Gulf of Mexico. With the cold air already entrenched over the region, this brought the moisture and atmospheric lift needed to generate precipitation. At first, the precipitation started as rain and freezing rain, with some light icing reported across the ArkLaMiss. As the atmosphere cooled through the late morning, the rain began to change to snow in the early afternoon across southeast Arkansas, northeast Louisiana and the Mississippi Delta. The changeover line from rain to snow slowly progressed from northwest to southeast across northern portions of the ArkLaMiss region. By the time the changeover occurred near the I-20 corridor, the precipitation was moving off to the east into Alabama.||Those who got snow north of I-20 saw several heavier bursts, which led to some high snowfall totals. The highest totals were generally along and north of the Highway 82 corridor. Locations from Grenada to northern Lowndes County saw the highest amounts in our county warning area, with totals ranging from six to eight inches. Those who saw the higher totals also dealt with trees being weighed down by the heavy snow. This led to snapping trees and numerous power outages.",75

Sleet and some snow began to mix into the Delta while the majority of the area saw a significant accumulation of sleet. Some areas in south and east Mississippi also saw some sleet but a little to no accumulation. Precipitation moved out late morning of March 5th.||Those who received a good amount of sleet and some snow accumulation (mainly along and northwest of the Natchez Trace corridor) saw anywhere between 1/2 inch to 1-2 inches in the far northern parts of the Delta and northern Mississippi. Due to being warm the two previous days, road issues were mainly limited to areas that received significant heavy sleet accumulation, mainly in the Delta and northern Mississippi. These areas saw numerous roads that were ice covered and very slick, making travel very hazardous. Areas in the Jackson Metro saw some slick roads but warm ground and road temperature from the previous few days alleviated some of the issues.",127

Strong surface high, near 1030mb, was building into the central and southern Plains. Tuesday, January 2nd, 2017 was much warmer being in the 70s with severe weather and tornadoes, while in the wake over the two days after on Wednesday and Thursday, strong surface high pressure with much cooler air gradually filtered in. The strongest push of strong high pressure and colder air began to move in Friday morning.||A sharp contrast in temperatures existed across the area from the lower Mississippi Valley into the Gulf of Mexico as a stalled frontal boundary stayed situated along the coast.

In addition, a strong upper level disturbance was helping to promote lift and an area of snowfall moving through Oklahoma/Arkansas region by early Friday morning. This area mostly stayed just to the north of the region. Along and over top of the shallow arctic airmass, as the upper disturbance approached, moisture began to overrun the cold air below by early Friday morning. This moisture gradually overran the entire region by mid-morning. The atmosphere contained a deep melting layer, that as a snowfall fell, it completely melted. However, there was enough of a layer below that near the ground that helped to refreeze most of the precipitation to fall in the form of sleet and freezing rain. Sleet began to fall by early morning over northeast Louisiana by early Friday morning and spreading to the north and east into most of the ArkLaMiss by mid morning to late afternoon. There were some cases of some shallow instability present for some thunder to occur with the sleet.||The main disturbance and lift occurred in the mid-late afternoon and heaviest sleet production occurred during that time, right around rush hour. To make matters worse, temperatures were hovering in the low 30s to upper 20s while precipitation was falling. Overall, with such cold temperatures throughout the afternoon, there was significant sleet accumulation, especially from Franklin Parish in Louisiana, southeast towards Adams County in Louisiana, over to Warren County in Mississippi, throughout the Jackson Metro area and east along I-20 towards Lauderdale County and as far north as Noxubee County. Heavy sleet occurred throughout this region, with some areas approaching a 1/2 to 1 inch of sleet. Some areas in east-northeast Mississippi had enough precipitation with temperatures cooling in the atmosphere to briefly change over to snow as well, near Meridian and east-northeast Mississippi. Most areas in southeast Mississippi were slower to change over to mixed precipitation until later in the event. With cold ground and road temperatures, significant icing and accumulation began across the roadways throughout portions of northeast Louisiana, central, east and northeast Mississippi, especially along the Interstate 20 corridor. This led to significant icing on roadways and bridges, leading to icy roadways and major traffic issues. Many accidents occurred across the region, leading to some major thoroughfares being shut down, at least temporarily, especially for portions of Interstate 55, Interstate 20 and other roadways. This led to many area residents encountering slow downs in traffic and some being stuck for many hours on the roadways. In addition, the Jackson International Airport had to be shut down due to icy runways. The disturbance gradually moved east late evening, helping the precipitation to taper off and move out by late evening, around 9-10PM.||The strong surface high built and strengthened near 1040mb, leading to much colder air filtering in overnight and through the weekend. This led to hard freeze conditions with highs struggling to reach the freezing mark, especially across central and northern areas. A snowpack existed over central Arkansas, northern Mississippi and southern Tennessee. With northerly winds over that snowpack, this helped to lock in even colder air and biting wind chills, with wind chills falling into the single digits over most of the area.

Heavy sleet occurred throughout this region, with some areas approaching a 1/2 to 1 inch of sleet. Some areas in east-northeast Mississippi had enough precipitation with temperatures cooling in the atmosphere to briefly change over to snow as well, near Meridian and east-northeast Mississippi. Most areas in southeast Mississippi were slower to change over to mixed precipitation until later in the event. With cold ground and road temperatures, significant icing and accumulation began across the roadways throughout portions of northeast Louisiana, central, east and northeast Mississippi, especially along the Interstate 20 corridor. This led to significant icing on roadways and bridges, leading to icy roadways and major traffic issues. Many accidents occurred across the region, leading to some major thoroughfares being shut down, at least temporarily, especially for portions of Interstate 55, Interstate 20 and other roadways.

Light accumulations of ice were also reported which brought down a couple of trees.","A complex weather pattern eventually evolved into a widespread winter weather event across the area on January 6th, 2017. Strong surface high, near 1030mb, was building into the central and southern Plains. Tuesday, January 2nd, 2017 was much warmer being in the 70s with severe weather and tornadoes, while in the wake over the two days after on Wednesday and Thursday, strong surface high pressure with much cooler air gradually filtered in. The strongest push of strong high pressure and colder air began to move in Friday morning.||A sharp contrast in temperatures existed across the area from the lower Mississippi Valley into the Gulf of Mexico as a stalled frontal boundary stayed situated along the coast. This helped the cold air stay locked in place over the area, with temperatures near freezing Friday morning. In addition, a strong upper level disturbance was helping to promote lift and an area of snowfall moving through Oklahoma/Arkansas region by early Friday morning. This area mostly stayed just to the north of the region. Along and over top of the shallow arctic airmass, as the upper disturbance approached, moisture began to overrun the cold air below by early Friday morning. This moisture gradually overran the entire region by mid-morning. The atmosphere contained a deep melting layer, that as a snowfall fell, it completely melted. However, there was enough of a layer below that near the ground that helped to refreeze most of the precipitation to fall in the form of sleet and freezing rain. Sleet began to fall by early morning over northeast Louisiana by early Friday morning and spreading to the north and east into most of the ArkLaMiss by mid morning to late afternoon. There were some cases of some shallow instability present for some thunder to occur with the sleet.||The main disturbance and lift occurred in the mid-late afternoon and heaviest sleet production occurred during that time, right around rush hour. To make matters worse, temperatures were hovering in the low 30s to upper 20s while precipitation was falling. Overall, with such cold temperatures throughout the afternoon, there was significant sleet accumulation, especially from Franklin Parish in Louisiana, southeast towards Adams County in Louisiana, over to Warren County in Mississippi, throughout the Jackson Metro area and east along I-20 towards Lauderdale County and as far north as Noxubee County. Heavy sleet occurred throughout this region, with some areas approaching a 1/2 to 1 inch of sleet. Some areas in east-northeast Mississippi had enough precipitation with temperatures cooling in the atmosphere to briefly change over to snow as well, near Meridian and east-northeast Mississippi. Most areas in southeast Mississippi were slower to change over to mixed precipitation until later in the event. With cold ground and road temperatures, significant icing and accumulation began across the roadways throughout portions of northeast Louisiana, central, east and northeast Mississippi, especially along the Interstate 20 corridor. This led to significant icing on roadways and bridges, leading to icy roadways and major traffic issues. Many accidents occurred across the region, leading to some major thoroughfares being shut down, at least temporarily, especially for portions of Interstate 55, Interstate 20 and other roadways. This led to many area residents encountering slow downs in traffic and some being stuck for many hours on the roadways. In addition, the Jackson International Airport had to be shut down due to icy runways. The disturbance gradually moved east late evening, helping the precipitation to taper off and move out by late evening, around 9-10PM.||The strong surface high built and strengthened near 1040mb, leading to much colder air filtering in overnight and through the weekend. This led to hard freeze conditions with highs struggling to reach the freezing mark, especially across central and northern areas. A snowpack existed over central Arkansas, northern Mississippi and southern Tennessee. With northerly winds over that snowpack, this helped to lock in even colder air and biting wind chills, with wind chills falling into the single digits over most of the area.
